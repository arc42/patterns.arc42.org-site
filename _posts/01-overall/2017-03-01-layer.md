## Layer

### Context

A large system that requires decomposition.

### Problem

Designing a complex systems with high- and low-level issues. 

### Known Uses

*  Virtual Machines

*  APIs

*  Information Systems 

### Forces

*  Source code changes should not ripple through the system

*  Interfaces should be stable

*  Parts of the system should be exchangeable

*  Reusability of low-level issues for other systems

*  Better understanding and maintainability 

*  Complex components needs further decomposition

*  Crossing components boundaries may impede performance, especially if substantial amount of data must be transferred over several boundaries

*  The system is build by a team of programmers, and work has to be subdivided along clear boundaries

### Consequences

*  Reuse of layers 

*  Support for standardization

*  Dependencies are kept local

*  Exchangeability

### Liabilites

*  Cascades of changing behavior 

*  Lower efficiency

*  Unnecessary work

*  Difficulty of establishing the correct granularity of layers
