#### Intent
A proxy represents another element, provides a surrogate or placeholder for another element,
e.g. to control access or add functionality to it.

#### Problem
Some elements (in the figure below it's called `RealSubject`) might be
resource-intensive, overloaded or difficult to enhance.

#### Solution

The proxy (placeholder) provides _exactly the same interface as the original object_.
In the following figure it's called `doSomething()`. A Consumer needing
`doSomething()` gets a reference to the `Proxy` instead of the `RealSubject`.

The proxy can control access to the real subject, can cache results or defer calls. No
change is needed an the consumer and the real subject.

#### Known Applications

* Security (or protection) Proxy: can be used to control access to a resource.

* Remote Proxy: In distributed (object) programming, a local object (_proxy_) represents a remote object
(one that lives in a different address space).

* Virtual Proxy: If some resource is _expensive_ in terms of memory, capacity, computing power or similar,
a proxy (skeleton) implementation might be helpful sometimes.

* Caching Proxy: Stores results that have already been computed by the original object.



#### Remarks

* Adapter provides a different interface to its subject. Proxy provides the same interface.
