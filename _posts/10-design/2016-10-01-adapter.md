**Intent**: Adapter makes otherwise incompatible elements cooperate.

**Problem**: An existing component offers some functionality that you would like to use,
but its "view of the world" (its interface to the functionality) is not diretly
compatible with your system. You need some way of _translating_ or _adapting_.

**Solution**
