**Intent**: Facade provides a simpler interface to a complicated subsystem.

**Problem**: An existing subsystem is complicated or difficult to use. A consumer wants to access
this subsystem, but does not want to use the complicated interface.

**Solution**

Create a "convenience interface" that facilitates access to the complex subsystem.
Such a facade might require internal logic or processing.

See the following _real world_ example:

**Remarks**

* Facade defines a new interface, whereas Adapter uses an existing interface.
