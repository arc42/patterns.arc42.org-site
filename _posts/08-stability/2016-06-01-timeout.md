#### Problem

How can I:

* Preserve responsiveness independent of downstream latency
* Stop waiting after a pre-determined period of time
* Take alternate action if timeout was reached


#### Solution

Allow only a specified period of time to elapse before a specified event is to take place,
unless another specified event occurs first;
in either case, the period is terminated when either event takes place.

For an example of practical application of _timeout_, see the
[CircuitBreaker stability pattern](), first described
by [Michael Nygard](https://pragprog.com/book/mnee/release-it).
