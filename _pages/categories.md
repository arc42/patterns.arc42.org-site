When reading different books or articles on software patterns, you will
notice that there are different and sometimes contradictory proposals
on how to _organize_ these patterns. Pragmatically I added patterns to
all potential categories

I reused some category proposals from [books]() and finally came up
with the following results:

1. [**Overall System Structure**](/overall/): Patterns to structure
systems or large components. Sometimes named _From Mud to Structure_, for example: Layers, Tiers, Master/Slave, Client/Server, Domain-Model, Transaction-Script, Virtual Machine.

1. [**Data flow**](/dataflow/):
Pipes-and-Filter and its variants, Blackboard

1. [**Interactive Systems**](/interactive/):  Model-View-Controller, Model-View-ViewModel and their variants

1. [**Integration Patterns**](/integration/):
Publish-Subscribe, Messaging, Remote-Procedure-Call, Hub-and-Spoke etc.

1. [**Adaptive Systems**](/adaptive/):
PlugIn, Broker, MicroServices

1. [**Domain Patterns**](/domain/):
Open-Host-Service, Published-Language, Anticorruption-Layer, Separate-Ways

1. [**Stability and Robustness Patterns**](/stability/):
Bulkhead, Timeout, Circuit-Breaker, Heartbeat, Handshake etc.

1. [**Resource Management Patterns**](/resource_management/): TODO

1. **Security Patterns**: TODO

1. **Microservice Patterns**: TODO

1. [**Workflow Patterns**](/workflow/): TODO

1. [**Design Patterns**](/design/): Fine-grained patterns, often associated
with class or object _structure_, _behavior_ or _creation_. I concentrate
on those which are independend of the underlying programming paradigm, e.g.
Proxy, Adapter, Facade, Registry, Command, Observer
