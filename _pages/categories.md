When reading different books or articles on software patterns, you will
notice that there are different and sometimes contradictory proposals
on how to _organize_ these patterns.

I reused some category proposals from [books]() and finally came up
with the following results:


1. [**Overall System Structure**](/overall/): Patterns to structure
systems or large components. Sometimes named _From Mud to Structure_, for example: Layers, Tiers, Master/Slave, Client/Server, Domain-Model, Transaction-Script, Virtual Machine.

1. [**Data flow**](/dataflow/): {{ nr_dataflow_patterns }} patterns, e.g. Pipes-and-Filter and its variants, Blackboard

1. [**Interactive Systems**](/interactive/): {{ nr_interactive_patterns  }} patterns, e.g. Model-View-Controller, Model-View-ViewModel and their variants

1. [**Integration Patterns**](/integration/): {{ nr_integration_patterns }} patterns, e.g. Publish-Subscribe, Messaging, Remote-Procedure-Call, Hub-and-Spoke etc.
1. [**Adaptive Systems**](/adaptive/): {{ nr_adaptive_patterns  }} patterns, e.g. PlugIn, Broker, MicroServices
1. [**Domain Patterns**](/domain/): {{ nr_domain_patterns }} patterns, e.g. Open-Host-Service, Published-Language, Anticorruption-Layer, Separate-Ways
1. [**Stability and Robustness Patterns**](/stability/): {{ nr_stability_patterns }} patterns, e.g. Bulkhead, Timeout, Circuit-Breaker, Heartbeat, Handshake etc.
1. [**Workflow Patterns**](/workflow/): {{ nr_workflow_patterns }} patterns, TODO
1. [**Design Patterns**](/design/): {{ nr_design_patterns  }} patterns, e.g. Proxy, Adapter, Facade, Registry, Command, Factory, Observer
